# Git and Node

At the end of this lesson you should have set up Git and Node.js on your computer. You can skip this lesson if you have already completed this as part of an earlier course in the specialization. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- ## Set up a Git repository and perform basic Git operations

- ## Set up and use online Git repositories

- ## Use Node-based modules to perform basic operations.

## Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn to install Git on your computer. Git is required for using all the remaining Node.js and Node based tools that we encounter in the rest of the course. At the end of this exercise, you would be able to:

- ### Install Git on your computer

- ### Ensure that Git can be used from the command-line or command-prompt on your computer

- ### Set up some of the basic global configuration for Git

## Downloading and Installing Git
To install Git on your computer, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads to download the Git installer for your specific computing platform.

Then, follow the installation steps as you install Git using the installer.

You can find more details about installing Git at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git. This document lists several ways of installing Git on various platforms.

Installing some of the GUI tools like GitHub Desktop will also install Git on your computer.

On a Mac, setting up XCode command-line tools also will set up Git on your computer.

You can choose any of the methods that is most convenient for you.

## Some Global Configuration for Git
- Open a cmd window or terminal on your computer.
- Check to make sure that Git is installed and available on the command line, by typing the following at the command prompt:
  - $ git --version
